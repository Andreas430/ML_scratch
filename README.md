Hands on Implementation from Scratch for Multivariate Linear Regression, Regression Forest, Gaussian Process and k-Nearest Neighbours


The task is to predict crop yield (tonnes per hectare) for the major maize crop of farms distributed across the entire planet (the major crop is the main crop of the year; farms may also grow a second crop with a lower yield). For each farm climate data is provided, specifically three features for each month:

● Total rainfall, in mm.

● Mean minimum temperature, in degrees celsius (minimum temperature for each day, averaged over the entire month).

● Mean maximum temperature. Likewise to above.

Year has also been included to account for improvements in farming techniques; the data
covers three decades

Four different algoriths were implented on the dataset and on a try problem to test their validity:
○ Linear regression
○ Regression forest 
○ Gaussian process
○ k-Nearest Neighbours
